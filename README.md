My first GitHub Project - Scientific Calculator

This is a program with a simple GUI created in Python3 using tkinter package. 
It allows to perform basis engineering calculations which includes trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions, etc.
For me as a person who has to solve various engineering tasks this program became very useful and efficient and doesn't use lots of memory space of my computer.
