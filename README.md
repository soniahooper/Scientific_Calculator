# SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

My first GitHub Project

This is a program with a simple GUI created in Python3 using a tkinter library.

My program allows to perform basic engineering calculations which includes trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic functions, etc.
For me as a person who has to solve various engineering tasks this program became very useful and efficient and it doesn't use a lot of memory space of my computer.
